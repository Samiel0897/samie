				<h4>Fillings are used to restore damaged, broken or
					decayed teeth. There are 2 types of filling materials used: Amalgam fillings or tooth colored
					fillings.
					Amalgam fillings are made from a mixture of metals. These fillings are extremely durable and have a
					longer life span. Tooth colored or composite fillings are made from a resin. These are a natural
					looking
					alternative. These fillings can be made virtually undetectable.</h4>

				<h4>Root Canal Treatment is required when the root of a tooth
					is damaged or decayed and at risk of being infected. The treatment consists of removing the
					infection
					and restructuring the core of the tooth, helping to prevent the need for an extraction in the

				<h4>We adopt a very minimal approach to Botox with the idea
					that less is more when it comes to the face. The only product we use is Allergan Botox which is the
					market leader and manufactured in Ireland (always a plus). Some other botulinum products are cheaper
					but, in my opinion, the results are not as good or long lasting which in the long run works out
					costing
					everybody more. The other area of facial cosmetics is fillers. these have seen huge growth in recent
					years, mainly because of social media. This treatment is mainly concentrated around the mouth area
					to
					get rid of smokers lines, flat lips, nasolabial folds and marionette lines at the corner of the
					mouth.
					While Botox takes a few days to see the affects, filler is more immediate and can last for up to 9
					months. We use both Allergan & Juvederm products and Vivacy Stylage as our main filler products.
					Both are leading brands in their fields. Kevin O’Brien</h4>

				<img src="images/ser5.png" alt="Botox" />
				<h4>What is botox? Botox is an injection that temporarily relaxes
					facial muscles reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as preventing new lines
					from
					forming. Common injection sites are the glabella (region between eyebrows), forehead and outer
					corners
					of eyes(crows feet).Treatment is fast and painless and lasts from 4 to 6 months. Dermal Fillers
					Dermal
					Fillers: The Procedure Firstly the area is evaluated to decide what areas would benefit you most.
					Injection usually takes only a few moments per site. The process of injecting, massaging, and
					evaluating
					the result is performed, and additional filler added as needed. Depending on the number of areas to
					be
					treated, the whole process may be as short as 15 minutes. Area is then wiped clean, if you
					experience a
					little swelling an ice pack would be recommended</h4>

				<h3> Cleaning & Whitening</h3>

<h4>Cleaning The mouth is an area that’s completely different from the entire body, and it takes quite a beating
			from the food we eat and the talking we do all day long. And this unique environment requires special
			care. Teeth cleanings remove the buildup of plaque and tartar. This buildup is for the most part natural
			But too much buildup leads to gum disease. Gum disease is when your body’s immune system is responding
			to this tartar buildup with inflamed and bleeding gums. The immune system response is successful at
			killing off invaders like infection and flu bugs, but at a cost: like a war, there are innocent
			bystanders that get slaughtered. As gum disease progresses, so does the destruction to your bone and
			tissues in your mouth. Your immune system is meant only to fight off infection for a short period of time —
			chronic activation of the immune system means it can get worn out and it won’t be as strong to fight off
			an illness. Chronic activation of the immune system can lead to diseases in the rest of your body.
			Whitening Many Products on the market claim to give you “Pearly Whites” however there is still nothing
			on the market that whitens teeth as much and as quickly as the traditional gel and mouth shield. How
			Does Tray Teeth Whitening Work? A whitening gel is placed in a tray that fits over your teeth. As the
			active ingredient in the gel, carbamide peroxide, is broken down, oxygen enters the enamel and bleaches the
			colored substances. The structure of the tooth is not changed; only the tooth is made lighter and
			whiter. Fillings, Crowns, and Bonding will not lighten. The fit of the tray is critical to success of
			treatment. Impressions are made by your dentist. Accurate models of your teeth are obtained from which
			custom fitting whitening trays can be made.We all want that Hollywood smile, and our results speak for
			themsleves.</h4>
